This example show how you can use Overlay's extended positioning support to align or center the overlay either in the viewport, or relative to another node on the page. You can specify any one of 9 points (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, top-center, bottom-center, left-center, right-center, center) to align on both the Overlay and the node/viewport it is being aligned to.
