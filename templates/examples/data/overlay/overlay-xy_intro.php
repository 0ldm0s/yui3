<p>This example walks you through basics of creating and positioning an Overlay. It walks you through setting up the sandbox environment for the Overlay, including the required modules, and instantiating the Overlay based on markup already on the page.</p>
<p>It also provides a couple of input fields, allowing you to invoke the Overlay's <code>move()</code> method, to move the Overlay to a specific XY position on the page.</p>
