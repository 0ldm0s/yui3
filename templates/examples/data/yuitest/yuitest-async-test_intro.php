<p>This example shows how to create an asynchronous test with the YUI Test framework for testing browser-based JavaScript code. 
  A <code>Y.Test.Case</code> object is created with a test that waits for a
  few seconds before continuing. The <code>Y.Test.Runner</code>
  is then used to run the tests once the page has loaded.</p>
