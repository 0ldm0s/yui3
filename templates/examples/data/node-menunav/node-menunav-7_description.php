<h3>Creating A Custom Skin</h3>
<p>
Skinning the menus created using the MenuNav Node Plugin is done using CSS.  The stylesheet used 
for other MenuNav Node Plugin examples is a minified version of the node-menunav-core.css and 
node-menunav-skin.css files.  The node-menunav-core.css file includes foundational styling that 
controls basic layout and positioning, whereas the node-menunav-skin.css file is used to apply 
colors, borders, padding, etc. 
</p>

<p>
Skinning can be accomplished by either overriding the styles defined in the node-menunav-skin.css 
file, or by creating an entirely new skin file.  In either case place custom styles in a separate 
file to simplify integrating with YUI updates.
</p>

<p>
When creating a custom skin, use the node-menunav-core.css and node-menunav-skin.css files as a 
reference.  Also consult the <a href="../../nodemenunav#css-reference">CSS reference</a> 
section of the MenuNav Node Plugin landing page, as it provides a complete list of all of the class 
names used by the MenuNav Node Plugin along with when and to what element(s) they are applied.
