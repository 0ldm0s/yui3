<p><code>merge</code> allows you to combine any number of input objects and output a single merged set.<p>
<p>
If the input is a single object, the return value will be a shallow copy of the input, meaning that the return value
is a different object, but any non-primitive value in the input object is referenced in the returned
object.

<p>Click the "Merge" button to generate the merged set, the "Copy" button to create a shallow copy of an object.</p>
