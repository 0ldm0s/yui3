<p>We've made it easy to customize the page width. <code>pixels/13 = ems</code> for all non-IE browsers. For IE, pixels/13.3333 = ems. (I find it useful to preserve up to four decimal places (1.2345) before rounding.)</p>

<p>This example shows three stacked divs, each with their own custom width applied. The first region is 400px wide, second is 500px, and the final region is 600px wide.</p>
