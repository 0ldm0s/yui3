<p>YUI CSS Grids provides a system for subdividing sections of your page with Nesting Grids. These Nesting Grids tell their child units how to divide space. Depending on the holder's class the children divide space differently.</p>
<p>The default grid holder is <code>div.yui-g</code> which tells its two child units, <code>div.yui-u</code>, to evenly divide the available space. Several special grid holders are available for non-50%/50% splits.</p>
