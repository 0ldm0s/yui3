<p>By default, <code>get</code> returns a reference to the attribute's value, if the value is an object. For normal use cases this is usually acceptable and avoids the performance cost of cloning the value returned. However if required, attributes can be configured using the <code>clone</code> configuration property to specify one of four clone modes, which <code>get</code> will honor when returning the attribute's value. This example demonstrates how the four clone modes work.
