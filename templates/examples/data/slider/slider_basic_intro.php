<p>This example walks you through the basics of creating a Slider from script.
Both Sliders in this example use the default value range of 0 - 100 and use
default skin resources provided with the Sam skin.</p>

<p>The first Slider is set up in a more traditional JavaScript coding style and
the second using the shorter method chaining style.  The first Slider is
configured to move along the vertical axis, and is initialized to a value of
30.  The second Slider is horizontal and instantiated with minimal
configuration.</p>
