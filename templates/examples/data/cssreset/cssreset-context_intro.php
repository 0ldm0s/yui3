<p>When CSS Reset is included in a page it applies rules to all HTML elements via type selectors like this: <code>h1 {margin:0;}</code>. An alternate version, <code>-context.css</code>, uses only descendent selectors like this: <code>.cssreset-context h1 {margin:0;}</code>. This means you can put that class value on a node in your document to choose which region(s) of your page CSS Reset will be applied to.</p>
