The YUI Global
    Provides core YUI functionality, including module registration and consumption utils,
    language/array/object utilities, browser detection, a setTimout/setInterval wrapper,
    and dynamic loading of script and css files.

    The yui module is a rollup of the following modules:
        yui-base
        get
        loader
