Running the tests (for now)

THESE TESTS ALL REQUIRE NODEJS

ant all; //To get the latest
cd ../yui
ant all;

npm -g i yui3
npm -g i yuitest

#This test configures YUI to load every module one at a time, then checks the ENV for missing modules

./scripts/build_loader_tests.js

yuitest ./tests/cli/loader.js


# This script, generates a simlar test. It uses the RLS method to generate a static js file
# That file is then included (via iframe) in a page that loads it in a try/catch
# it will the report if it passed or not
# once all modules have been tested, it takes the results and populates a YUITest Suite
# to execute tests against the results
