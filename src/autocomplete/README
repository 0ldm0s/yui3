Change History
--------------

3.4.0

  * Added subWordMatch filters and highlighters. [Contributed by Tobias
    Schultze]

  * Small performance improvement for filters and highlighters operating on
    empty query strings. [Ticket #2529949]

  * Fixed a bug that prevented CSS-based z-index values from taking effect on
    the AutoComplete list and required the z-index to be set via JS. The
    .yui3-aclist class now provides a default z-index of 1, and this can be
    overridden with custom CSS. Specifying a 'zIndex' attribute value via JS
    no longer has any effect.

  * Fixed a bug that caused the IE6 iframe shim under the AutoComplete list to
    be sized incorrectly the first time the list was displayed.

  * Fixed a bug in which the requestTemplate would sometimes be used as the
    query instead of being appended to the source URL. This affected XHR and
    JSONP sources that used both a {query} placeholder in the source string and
    a custom requestTemplate value. [Ticket #2529895]

3.3.0

  * Initial release.
