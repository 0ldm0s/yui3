3.0.0PR1 - Initial release

*** NOTE: This module is deprecated.  YUI CSS will be broken out into a separate project in the future.

Module Name: "cssreset"
Documentation: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/cssreset

The foundational CSS Reset removes the inconsistent styling
of HTML elements provided by browsers. This creates a 
dependably flat foundation to built upon. With CSS Reset 
loaded, begin writing the explicit CSS your project needs.
