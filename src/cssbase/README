3.0.0PR1 - Initial release

*** NOTE: This module is deprecated.  YUI CSS will be broken out into a separate project in the future.

Module Name: "cssbase"
Documentation: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/cssbase

CSS Base is an optional CSS file that complements YUI's 
core CSS foundation (CSS Reset, CSS Fonts, and CSS Grids). 
CSS Base applies a style foundation for HTML elements 
that is consistent for A-grade browsers.

CSS Base may also be useful as a template for your own 
base file, or a snippets library for styling HTML elements.

Many individual values within Base can be overwritten 
locally by setting them to auto or inherit.
