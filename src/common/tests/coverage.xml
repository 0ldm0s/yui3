<!-- These tests are ready for automated test coverage.

     If you'd like your test to be included here:

     1. Only use build/yui/yui.js in your tests.
        Don't use yui-debug.js or yui-min.js.

     2. Make sure your test respects the filter
        query string parameter by using something
        like this in your test's YUI config:

            var Y = YUI({
                filter: (window.location.search.match(/[?&]filter=([^&]+)/) || [])[1] || 'min'
            });

     Then make sure ?filter=raw only includes raw JS.
     Coverage tests are not allowed to use debug or min filters.

     Feel free to add your test if it respects ?filter=raw.
