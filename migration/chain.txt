Chain 3.0 Planning (included in DataTable)

Thoughts on 2.x implementation

* Bundled with DataTable
    Chain has value outside the context of DataTable for managing thread yielding and queued operations.

    3.0 thoughts:
    Extract to Y.chain or Y.queue.  Discuss naming with team and possibly internal consumption.

==========
Misc

Chain supports functions or obj lits containing keys method, scope, args, timeout, iterations, and until.  scope and argument can be removed to leverage Y.bind.

Animation may be able to leverage Chain.
