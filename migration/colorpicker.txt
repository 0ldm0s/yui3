ColorPicker 3.0 Planning

Thoughts on 2.x implementation

* Too many privates
    Many of the methods and values used internally are scope private, requiring a number of _theMeth.call(this) stuff.  Better that they be moved to gentleman's privates.

    3.0:
    Except for load time forking avoid true privates unless there's a compelling reason to include them.

* Elem/RGBElem -> jsonml
    Internally, CP uses a series of convenience methods Elem and RGBElem to generate its node structure.

    3.0:
    Move to Node.create+jsonml mechanism.  Discuss with Matt/Adam node structure caching ala structure templating for performance/convenience.


* util.Color useful outside CP
    
    3.0:
    Extract Color class for consumption by CP + Anim + Dom style stuff (et al?)
