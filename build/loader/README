Progress:

    Removed dom and node, added loader and get: 38k
        - Appears to work more or less with no issues as long as the metadata is correct.

    Removed loader custom events, removed event: 22k
        - This is working but will require some thought around DOMReady.
          This is a single moment and needs to be there initially to
          be effective.  On the other hand, if we are generally loading
          asynchronously, it will probably have fired...
        - Event may need to be split up because of the above, and it
          may make sense to split it furthur since it is possible (but
          unlikely) that something would require the custom event system
          but would not need the DOM event system.

Additional possibilities that may not be difficult:

    Split out inheritance utilities since I believe that these are not needed by core.

    UA probably could be a standalone util.  I don't believe it is needed until
    we get into DOM stuff.

More effort:

    Audit core and remove sub-divide everything not used by use/add/get/loader.
    I don't anticipate too much that can easily be gainer here because I
    already did this to some degree to isolate what is absolutely required by
    the YUI global (what isn't used by the module registration system).  Of the
    remaining modules, 'object' and 'later' are the only modules left that
    could be removed if only refactoring get and loader.  Anything else would
    likely require more surgery.


---------------------------------------------------------------

Moved event related YUI API to event
Moved most inheritance utils to oop module (mix and merge still in core)

20k

---------------------------------------------------------------

Minified file size for potential core module reduction

UA: 685 // required by get
later: 420 // required by get, but can be refactored
log: 481 // build system should only include this in -debug?  Would reduce Y.fail functionality
Object: 411 // can be reduced

---------------------------------------------------------------

yui:
    move Y.namespace

loader:
    make rollup optional download
    change metadata structure to understand 3.x build structure default locations
    
lang:
    move items not used in core into another module

array:
    move each into file with Y.each def
    move items unused in core elsewhere

object:
    move each into file with Y.each def
    remove owns
    remaining: Object() Object.keys

general:
    constants
    error message symbols (symbol description optional module)
