    DOM event utilities and the YUI custom event system

3.0.0pr2
    - Fixed IE notification error when no arguments are supplied.
    - Added event-simulate.
    - getListeners works when the element has no listeners defined.
    - Event.addListener removed.  Exists only in compat layer.
    - addListerer triggers 2.x event behavior.
    - Removed extra undefined parameter passed to DOM event listeners.
    - Compat layer contains Event.on.
    - Event adapter support added to Y.on
    - Added Y.on('focus', 'blur' event adaptors (support for propagation
      of these events.)
    - publish and subscribe support an object for the type, allowing for multiple
      events/subscriptions.
    - subscriber failures throw an error by default rather than log.
    - subscriber failures are not routed through Y.fail in order to
      improve the debug experience.
